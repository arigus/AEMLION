# AEMLION
The AEMLION is a 0.8x0.6inch (20x15mm) PCB with the AEM10941 Solar Harvesting IC from E-peas. It efficiently converts solar energy into Li-ion battery charge, it even works with indoor light. It features 3.3V and 1.8V regulated outputs that are enabled when the battery has useful charge, and a low battery warning that informs the user of impending shutdown when the battery runs low. It easily integrates in other projects because of small size, castelllated via's, and when soldered onto 0.1" pitch header it fits in a bread board.
